The keepalived executable has been moved from the build directory
`/usr/local/src/keepalived-x.y.z/sbin/keepalived` to

previous version is not removed during an upgrade. This needs to be done
manually.

  wrong path variables"

  by [christian.hueser.hzdr](https://gitlab.com/christian.hueser.hzdr)).
